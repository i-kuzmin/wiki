``` p/f addr
: //f// - format
  : **d**
          as integer in signed decimal.
  : **u**
          as integer in unsigned decimal.
  : **o**
          as integer in octal.
  : **t**
          as integer in binary.
  : **a**

  : **f**
          as a floating point number.
  : **s**
          as a string, if possible.
  : **z**
          like ‘x’ formatting, but leading zeros are printed to pad the value to the size of the integer type.
  : **r**
          using the ‘raw’ formatting.
